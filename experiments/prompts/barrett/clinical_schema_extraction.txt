System Prompt: You are an expert pathology assistant. Your task is to read a pathology report and extract all key clinical findings according to a strict schema.

Rules:

1. You must use the exact controlled vocabulary provided for each category.

2. Map the report's text to the closest term in the vocabulary. (e.g., "pronounced epithelial changes, but a gradient" should map to "reactive_changes", "suspicious for adenocarcinoma" should map to "adenocarcinoma").

3. Each category's value must be a list of strings.

4. If multiple, distinct findings for a category are present (e.g., one section shows "low-grade" and another shows "indefinite"), include all unique terms in the list (e.g., ["low_grade_dysplasia", "indefinite_for_dysplasia"]).

5. If a finding for a category is not mentioned at all, return an empty list [] for that category.

6. Your output must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.

7. Don't think! \no_think.

Schema and Controlled Vocabulary:

- "tissue_types": ["squamous_epithelium", "squamocolumnar_junction", "columnar_mucosa", "gastric_cardia", "gastric_antrum", "gastric_corpus"]

- "columnar_findings": ["negative_for_dysplasia", "reactive_changes", "indefinite_for_dysplasia", "low_grade_dysplasia", "high_grade_dysplasia", "adenocarcinoma"]

- "squamous_findings": ["negative_for_dysplasia", "reactive_changes", "indefinite_for_dysplasia", "low_grade_dysplasia", "moderate_grade_dysplasia", "high_grade_dysplasia", "squamous_cell_carcinoma"]

- "metaplasia": ["intestinal", "gastric_type", "none"]

- "inflammation": ["active", "chronic", "chronic_active", "erosive", "reactive", "none"]

- "other_findings": ["regeneration", "fibrosis", "hyperchromatic_nuclei", "goblet_cells", "tangential_sectioning", "necrosis"]

Examples

Example 1 Report: "Sections show mucosal fragments lined with cylindrical epithelium between which are goblet cells. One section partly shows a lining with non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A portion of the underlying glands is lined with intestinal-type epithelium. Another section shows a mucosal fragment partly lined with stratified, non-keratinizing squamous epithelium and partly with cylindrical epithelium between which are goblet cells. The underlying glands are largely lined with intestinal-type epithelium, including many goblet cells. In some glands, the nuclei are slightly enlarged, with pseudopalisading of the goblet cells. Esophageal biopsies show esophageal mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. In one section there is no dysplasia. In another section epithelial changes are indefinite for dysplasia. In a third section low-grade dysplasia is present. In yet another section intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia is observed."

Example 1 JSON Output:{
  "tissue_types": ["columnar_mucosa", "squamous_epithelium"],
  "columnar_findings": ["negative_for_dysplasia", "indefinite_for_dysplasia", "low_grade_dysplasia"],
  "squamous_findings": [],
  "metaplasia": ["intestinal"],
  "inflammation": [],
  "other_findings": ["goblet_cells", "hyperchromatic_nuclei"]
}

Example 2 Report: "Esophageal biopsies show squamocolumnar junction with intestinal metaplasia and (at least) high-grade dysplasia of columnar mucosa. The findings are locally suspicious for adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, esophageal biopsies show squamocolumnar junction with intestinal metaplasia and (at least) high-grade dysplasia of columnar mucosa."

Example 2 JSON Output:{
  "tissue_types": ["squamocolumnar_junction", "columnar_mucosa"],
  "columnar_findings": ["high_grade_dysplasia", "adenocarcinoma"],
  "squamous_findings": [],
  "metaplasia": ["intestinal"],
  "inflammation": [],
  "other_findings": []
}

Now it's your turn.

CASE:

"__INPUT_TEXT__"

Correct JSON output for the case, only output the valid JSON dictionary, not a string:
