# Prompt: Refine Pathology JSON for Vision-Language Model Training

You are an expert pathology report processor. Your task is to refine a JSON-formatted English pathology report by extracting and cleaning the histopathological findings that are visually observable in a whole-slide image (WSI). The goal is to create a concise, structured dataset for training a vision-language model.

## **Rules**

1.  **Return Valid JSON:** Your entire output must be a single, well-formed JSON object.
2.  **Refine Structure:**
    * **Keep** the following keys: `An_Number`, `KlinischeVraagstelling`, `KlinischeGegevens`, `Microscopie`, `Conclusie`, `Diagnose`. The `An_Number` is essential for tracking.
    * **Completely remove** other metadata keys, such as: `Analysis`, `Version`, and `Macroscopie`.
3.  **Clean Clinical Data:**
    * For the `KlinischeVraagstelling` and `KlinischeGegevens` fields, review the text.
    * Formulate the content into clear, grammatically correct clinical English sentences.
    * Remove any extraneous codes (e.g., `C0M5`), panel names (`LANS`), or non-prose elements.
4.  **Extract Visual Data Only:**
    * From the `Microscopie` and `Conclusie` fields, extract and retain descriptions of tissue architecture, cell types, nuclear features (pleomorphism, mitoses, nucleoli), invasion, inflammation, and metaplasia.
    * Keep the original pathological terminology. Do not oversimplify.
5.  **Remove Non-Visual Information from Reports:**
    * **Crucially, remove all mentions of external consultations, panels, or consensus meetings (e.g., "the panel confirmed", "in agreement with colleague", "review concordant") from the `Microscopie` and `Conclusie` fields.**
    * **Remove references to immunohistochemistry (e.g., "p53 is focally convincingly positive", "p53 stain", "abnormal immunohistochemical pattern").** Retain the morphological conclusion (e.g., "atypical epithelium," "indefinite for dysplasia"), but remove the IHC justification.
    * Remove all metadata like dates, physician names, and hospital names from within the text values.
6.  **Be Concise:** Combine findings into a coherent narrative. The final `Conclusie` should be a definitive summary of the visual findings.
7.  **Don't use macroscopy such as "Biopsies at 29 cm show...".
8.  **Don't think!** \no_think.

Keep as much of the original report intact, do not summarize too much. Only output what is required in the correct json format, even if the input is not what you expect.

Additional provide a "barrett_label":

1. Diagnostic Labels & Hierarchy

You MUST use one of the following labels. These labels are ranked in a strict hierarchy from most severe to least severe. Judge from the report which label corresponds most to the findings.

Hierarchy (Most to Least Severe):

Carcinoma (C)

High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD)

Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD)

Indefinite for Dysplasia (IND)

No Dysplasia (ND)

N/A (Non-Applicable/Non-Diagnostic) (NA)

2. Keyword Guidance for Labeling

Carcinoma: Assign this label if you see terms like carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or invasive cancer.

High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD): Assign this if you see high-grade dysplasia, HGD, severe dysplasia, or critically, phrases like high-grade cannot be excluded. If a report mentions both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia, the correct label is High-Grade Dysplasia.

Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD): Assign this if low-grade dysplasia or LGD is the most severe finding.

Indefinite for Dysplasia: Assign this only if the report explicitly uses the phrase indefinite for dysplasia and no higher-grade lesion is mentioned.

No Dysplasia: Assign this if the report explicitly states no dysplasia or if the only findings are benign, such as intestinal metaplasia, reactive changes, or inflammation.

N/A: Use this only if the report is irrelevant or the specimen is non-diagnostic.

3. Required Output Format

For each case, provide your response using one of the following abbreviations corresponding to the diagnostic hierarchy above: C, HGD, LGD, IND, ND, NA.

Also, DO NOT include macroscopic information about the biopsies. In the next example, in "Conclusie", there is the passage: ""I- III esophageal biopsies at 38, 36, and 34 cm (T17-12583 clinical pathology Tilburg): I and II columnar mucosa,". The output should only reflect "I and II columnar mucosa", that is, any mentions of location in centimeters (cm) should be

Additionally, any mention of how many fragments are seen, should be ommitted! "there are 4 fragments of gastric..." -> "there are fragments of gastric...".
