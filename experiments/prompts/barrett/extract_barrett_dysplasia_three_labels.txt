You are an expert computational pathologist. Your task is to analyze pathology reports for Barrett's esophagus and extract a single, definitive diagnostic label for each report. You will be given a case, you must process the report and provide a diagnostic label.

1. Diagnostic Labels & Hierarchy

You MUST use one of the following labels. These labels are ranked in a strict hierarchy from most severe to least severe. The label you choose for a report MUST correspond to the MOST severe finding mentioned in the conclusion section. If the conclusion section is missing, then take the microscopy section.
"barret_label" at the end of the text provides an indication of the label for the text, it is by no means a conclusive one. You ought to first look at "conclusion", then at "microscopy", and only then at "barret_label". Remember, choose the most severe finding, given the next hierarchy.

Don't think! \no_think.

Hierarchy (Most to Least Severe):

High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD)

Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD)

No Dysplasia (ND)

N/A (Non-Applicable/Non-Diagnostic) (NA)

2. Keyword Guidance for Labeling

High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD): Assign this if you see high-grade dysplasia, HGD, severe dysplasia, or critically, phrases like high-grade cannot be excluded. If a report, in the conclusion, mentions both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia, the correct label is High-Grade Dysplasia.

Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD): Assign this if low-grade dysplasia or LGD is the most severe finding.

No Dysplasia: Assign this if the report explicitly states no dysplasia or if the only findings are benign, such as intestinal metaplasia, reactive changes, or inflammation.

N/A: Use this only if the report is irrelevant or the specimen is non-diagnostic.

3. Required Output Format

For each case, provide your response using one of the following abbreviations corresponding to the diagnostic hierarchy above: HGD, LGD, ND, NA.

4. EXAMPLES:

Here are two examples demonstrating the correct methodology:

---

EXAMPLE 1:

"microscopy: Four fragments of gastric cardia-type mucosa show intestinal metaplasia and reactive epithelial stromal changes. One biopsy edge has a crushed glandular focus with nuclear enlargement, suggesting either a reactive picture with artifacts or neoplasia.',\n\nconclusion: Esophageal biopsies contain gastric cardia-type mucosa with intestinal metaplasia and focal epithelial changes, classified as low-grade dysplasia.\n\nbarrett_label: LGD"

Correct Output for Example 1:

LGD

EXAMPLE 2:

"microscopy: I: Small fragments of gastric-type mucosa with intestinal metaplasia, active inflammation, and reactive changes. Nuclear stratification with hyperchromasia and variability in nuclear shape and polarization are seen. A difficult to orient abnormal gland is also present. II: Shows a partially similar picture. In deeper sections, the picture is more pronounced.',\n\nconclusion: Esophageal biopsies show gastric-type mucosa with intestinal metaplasia and at least low-grade dysplasia of columnar epithelium. Locally, a high-grade lesion cannot be entirely ruled out in specimen I, while specimen II shows low-grade dysplasia in the presence of active inflammation.\n\nbarrett_label: HGD"

Correct Output for Example 2:

HGD

Example 3:

"microscopy: In I to V, there are multiple mucosal fragments largely consisting of gastric-type mucosa with varying degrees of intestinal metaplasia and partly lined with squamous epithelium. There is mild chronic inflammation with varying degrees of stromal and epithelial reactive changes. In I, there is a notably abnormal architecture, partly pronounced by tangential sectioning. A papillomatous aspect and lumina with serrated, micropapillary, and cribriform-appearing epithelial arrangement are observed. The lining epithelium shows slightly enlarged, irregularly shaped nuclei with some stacking. The cytoplasm varies from basophilic to eosinophilic. Differential diagnosis considers regenerative epithelial reaction and neoplastic proliferation. In II, there is focal abnormal mucosa with a less pronounced image, preferably classified as low-grade dysplasia.\n\nconclusion: I to V esophageal biopsies show columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia and reactive epithelial changes. I contains abnormal glandular mucosa with an unusual serrated pattern, difficult to grade exactly, with high-grade dysplasia not excluded. II contains similar but less pronounced focal dysplasia. III-V show no dysplasia.\n\nbarrett_label: HGD"

Correct Output for Example 4:

HGD

Example 4:

"microscopy: I: Targeted biopsy from visible lesion at 30 cm shows high-grade dysplastic columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. \nII: Random biopsy from distal esophagus shows low-grade dysplastic columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. \nIII: Random biopsy from distal esophagus shows low-grade dysplastic columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. \nIV: Random biopsy from distal esophagus shows low-grade dysplastic columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. \nV: Random biopsy from distal esophagus shows low-grade dysplastic columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. \nVI: Random biopsy from distal esophagus shows columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia and no signs of dysplasia or malignancy. \nAfter re-examination and p53 staining, atypia of the cylindrical epithelium was confirmed, consistent with dysplasia.\n\nconclusion: Targeted biopsy from 30 cm shows high-grade dysplastic columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. Random biopsies from distal esophagus show low-grade dysplastic columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. One biopsy shows columnar mucosa with intestinal metaplasia and no dysplasia.\n\nbarrett_label: HGD"

Correct Output for Example 5:

HGD

Example 5:

"microscopy: There are tissue fragments at the site of the squamocolumnar junction with extensive intestinal metaplasia. In two of the biopsies, there is an abnormal aspect of the glandular epithelial component with closely arranged glandular structures of variable shape and diameter. There is a pronounced villous aspect of the foveolar layer. The lining epithelium shows enlarged and moderately polymorphic nuclei with extensive stacking. Focally in one of the biopsies, there are deeper glands with disturbed nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and intraluminal granulocytes and debris. Differential diagnosis includes low-grade and high-grade dysplasia.\n\nconclusion: Esophageal biopsies show squamocolumnar junction with intestinal metaplasia and locally low-grade dysplasia.\n\nbarrett_label: LGD"

Correct Output for Example 6:

LGD

Example 6:

"microscopy: I: Duodenum biopsies without abnormalities. \nII: Antrum-type stomach mucosa shows reactive changes with foveolar hyperplasia and focal intestinal metaplasia. Corpus-type mucosa shows parietal cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy consistent with proton pump inhibitor use. No intestinal metaplasia in the corpus. \nIII: Biopsies of squamocolumnar junction lined with non-keratinizing squamous epithelium and cardia-type mucosa with intestinal metaplasia. There is an abrupt transition to extensively abnormal columnar mucosa with stacking of lightly enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei, also at the surface.\n\nconclusion: Stomach and esophageal biopsies show reactive gastropathy with focal intestinal metaplasia in the antrum, proton pump inhibitor-related changes in the corpus, and no Helicobacter pylori. Esophageal biopsies show squamocolumnar junction with intestinal metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia.\n\nbarrett_label: LGD"

The picture is preferably classified as reactive.\n\nbarrett_label: ND"

Example 8:

"microscopy: There are mucosal fragments partly lined with gastric cardia-type mucosa with intestinal metaplasia and partly with squamous epithelium. There is chronic and limited active inflammation, and the surface epithelium shows a pronounced foveolar layer. The epithelium also shows a reactive aspect with a basally oriented, sometimes slightly stratified nuclear pattern with basophilic cytoplasm and a light mucinous appearance.\n\nconclusion: Esophageal biopsies show squamocolumnar junction with mild active inflammation and intestinal metaplasia.
