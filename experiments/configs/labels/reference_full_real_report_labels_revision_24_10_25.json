In one of the biopsies, there is a clearly abnormal aspect with a cellular lamina propria with active stroma and a mixed-cellular infiltrate. There is, in multiple places, overgrowth of granulocytes on the epithelium, where there is also atypia of the nuclear image noticeable. Differential diagnosis considers low-grade dysplasia and a reactive cell picture in the context of active inflammation.

In particular, in one of the biopsies, there is a slightly more aberrant aspect with a limited amount of intra-epithelial granulocytes, some atypia of the nuclear image with enlargement and rounding. As far as assessable, there is also loss of mucous neck cells in the foveolar layer, however, reactive changes due to surface damage are also present. Differential diagnosis considers low-grade dysplasia and a reactive cell picture. The material shows squamocolumnar junction with focal atypia of gastric-type mucosa, classifiable as reactive in inflammation, with no dysplasia identified.",
