COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by. following the manufacturer S instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance.

This section has been reviewed and approved by the. nn. Staging. Staging is a way of describing a cancer, such as where it is located, if or where it has spread, and if it. is affecting the functions of other organs in the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to determine the. cancer's stage, so staging may not be complete until all the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps. the doctor to decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient's prognosis (chance. of recovery). There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancers. There is no standard system for staging thymoma; however, the most commonly used system is called. the Masaoka system. This system was developed in. and it classifies thymoma into the following. stages: Stage I: The cancer is limited to the thymus and the capsule that surrounds it. Stage II: The cancer has spread into fat surrounding the thymus or into the lining of the lung next to. the tumor, called the mediastinal pleura. Stage III: The cancer has spread to other organs that are near the thymus, such as the lung, blood. vessels, and the sac around the heart, called the pericardium. Stage IVA: The cancer has spread more extensively into the lining of the lung or the sac around the. heart. Stage IVB: The cancer has spread to organs further away from the thymus, or has spread through the. vessels carrying blood or lymph. Classification. In addition to its stage, thymoma can be classified into different categories, developed by the. ), based on what the tumor cells look like under a microscope: Type A thymoma. This is also called spindle cell thymoma or medullary thymoma. The chance of. recovery for people with type A thymoma is good, with a. survival rate (percentage of. people who survive at least. after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other. diseases) near. TypeAB thymoma. Also called mixed thymoma, type AB thymoma is similar to type A thymoma;. however, type AB thymoma has lymphocytes in the tumor. The chance of recovery for people with. type AB thymoma is also good, with a. survival rate of approximately. %. Type B1 thymoma. This is also known as lymphocyte-rich thymoma, lymphocytic thymoma,. predominantly cortical thymoma, and organoid thymoma. This type of thymoma has very many. lymphocytes in the tumor, but the cells of the thymus appear normal. The chance of recovery for. people with type B1 thymoma is also good, with a 20-year relative survival rate (percentage of people. who survive at least. years after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other. diseases) of approximately. Type B2 thymoma. Type B2 thymoma also has many lymphocytes, like type B1 thymoma; however,. the thymus cells do not appear normal. Type B2 thymoma is also known as cortical thymoma and. polygonal cell thymoma. The. Fyear relative survival rate for people with type B2 thymoma is. approximately. Type B3 thymoma. Type B3 thymoma is also known as epithelial thymoma, atypical thymoma,. squamoid thymoma, and well-differentiated thymic carcinoma. This type of thymoma has few. lymphocytes, and the thymus cells look abnormal. The. survival rate is approximately. Thymic carcinoma. Thymic carcinoma, previously called type C thymoma, is very rare and more. aggressive. Thymic carcinoma cells do not look like normal thymus cells, but like cancers in other. organs of the body. This type of tumor is often advanced when diagnosed. It is classified into two. categories: low grade, which has a better chance of recovery, and high grade, which is more likely to. grow and spread quickly. Low-grade thymic carcinoma includes basaloid, mucoepidermoid, and well-. differentiated squamous cell types. High-grade thymic carcinoma includes anaplastic/undifferentiated. clear cell, poorly differentiated squamous cell, sarcomatoid, and small cell/neuroendocrine types. The. five-year relative survival rate of people with thymic carcinoma is. rate of people with thymic carcinoma is. %. Cancer survival statistics should be interpreted with caution. These estimates are based on data from. thousands of cases of this type of cancer in the United States, but the actual risk for a particular. individual may differ. It is not possible to tell a person how long he or she will live with thymoma. < Previous. Next >.","Thymoma with microscopic transcapsular invasion, margins involved.

The specimen is received in formalir and consists of a single lobe of. lung, weighing 212 grams and measuring 15 X 14 x 14 cm in overall dimensions. The hilar region consists of two portions of bronchus, measuring 1.5 cm in. length X 1.0 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in length X 1.0 cm in diameter. There. is also a 0.5 cm portion of vessel (the hilum). The structures are surrounded. by six gray-black lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest. dimension. There are also two stapled resection margins at the hilum,. measuring 7.5 cm in length and 2.0 cm in length. The stapled margins are. trimmed and inked green. The hilar region is inked black. The pleural. surface is purple-black with moderate anthracotic pigmentation. The surface. is smooth with the exception of the 0.5 cm area of puckering on the lateral. aspect. The pleural surface in this area is inked black. On sectioning,. there is a well-circumscribed mass adjacent to the puckered area which. measures 5 X 5 X 4.5 cm. The cut surface of the mass is yellow-tan soft and. gritty. with anthracotic pigmentation. The borders of the mass are rounded. serpiginous. The mass involves 40% of the cut surface and comes to within 1.0. cm of the vascular resection margin, 1.5 cm from the stapled resection margin,. and 1.8 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The mass surrounds vascular. and bronchial structures. On sectioning through the bronchus, the vessels are. yellow-tan and smooth. There is no obvious involvement of the bronchial and. vascular structures by the aforementioned mass. The mass abuts the inked. pleural surface. The remainder of the specimen consists of mildly crepitant. pink-red parenchyma. There is minimal anthracotic pigmentation. On. sectioning, scattered gray-black intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified. (cassette 8). No additional masses or lesions are identified. Representative. sections are submitted in ten cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - bronchial. and vascular margins; cassette 2 - mass and portion of bronchus; cassette 3 -. mass with vessel; cassette 4 - mass with inked pleural surface; cassette 5 -. mass with surrounding uninvolved parenchyma; cassettes 6 through 8 -. uninvolved parenchyma with the stapled resection margin in cassette 6;. cassette 9 one lymph node, bisected; cassette 10 five lymph nodes.

The vascular and bronchial margins are free of tumor, and the. lesion is present approximately 1.0 mm beneath the inked pleural surface. (slide E4). The surrounding lung parenchyma shows emphysematous changes with. areas of congestion. In addition, two intraparenchymal lymph nodes are. evaluated with no evidence of malignancy.
