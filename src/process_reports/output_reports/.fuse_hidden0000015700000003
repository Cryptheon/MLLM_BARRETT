It consists of a mastectomy. specimen which weighs 381 grams. A black suture at one end of the skin ellipse marks medial. With this. orientation, the specimen measures 16 cm from medial to lateral, 11 cm from superior to inferior, and 4. cm from anterior to posterior. There is an overlying ellipse of tan skin measuring 11.8 x 7 cm. The areola. measures 3.3 cm and the nipple appears slightly inverted. The anterior-superior margin is inked blue, the. anterior-inferior margin is inked green, and the posterior margin. which consists variably of smooth facial. appearing tissue and lobulated fatty tissue, is inked black. The breast is serially sectioned along the. superior-inferior axis resulting in fifteen slabs. Slab #1 is most medial. In the central portion of the excision, in slabs 6-9, there is a stellate hard, gritty neoplasm (tumor #1) which. overall measures 4 cm from medial to lateral, 1.2 cm from superior to inferior, and 1 cm from anterior to. posterior. This neoplasm is 1.5 cm from the closest skin. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin. and is greater than 4 cm from all other margins. Representative sections of the medial portion of the tissue. are obtained for research purposes and the biopsy site clip is identified within the neoplasm in slab 7. Slab 10 (intervening tissue between tumor #1 and tumors #2 and #3) consists of palpably unremarkable. fibrofatty tissue. In slab 11, 1 cm lateral to the tumor #1, there is chalky yellow discoloration and slight retraction of the. fibrofatty tissue suggestive of two small deposits of neoplastic tissue. The larger of these (tumor #2) is 8 cm. lateral to the nipple. It measures 1.4 x 1 x 0.6 cm and is greater than 2 cm from the anterior-superior,. anterior-inferior, and posterior margins. It is 2.3 cm from the closest lateral margin and widely free of the. medial margin. The smaller tumor deposit (tumor #3) measures 0,5 cm and is 0.8 cm superior of the larger deposit in slab. 11. It is 2 cm from the closest anterior-superior margin and greater than 2 cm from all other margins. No. other palpable lesions are identified.

Interpretation of findings: A) (positive) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 control. chromosome 1q25 signals and 1 chromosome 1p36 signals (locus of. interest) The ratio of 1p36/1q25 is <0.8. The results are consistent. with the loss of 1p36 locus of interest. B) (positive) The majority. of tumors cells displayed 2 control chromosome 19p13 signals and 1. chromosome 19q13 signals (locus of interest) The ratio of. 19q13/19p13 is <0.8. The results are consistent with the loss of 1p36. locus of interest. Number of Observers: 2. Test Interpreted By: Comments. The resultant FISH section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed. medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA-approved, validated. emi-automated scanning imaging workstation. and accompanying imaging. analysis software. The resultant FISH section/slide is then. presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH. results from. and compares them to the results manually observed. under. Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the ratio is enumerated. by computer-aided counting. as well as manual counting. Interpretation of Test. The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of. 1p36 signals by the total number of 1q25 signals in at least 20. interphase nuclei with. nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no. signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for. probe set 2 is derived by dividing the total number of. 19q13 signals by. the total number of 19p13 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase. nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two. different areas of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of. only one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for. allelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both. probe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For. both probe set 1 and 2 a ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets. of 20 interphase nuclei at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is. consistent with allelic loss.

COMMENT: The tumor is a poorly differentiated endometrioid endometrial. adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation and focal. neuroendocrine differentiation. Histologically, the tumors in. the ileum and urinary bladder present an appearance suggestive of. neuroendocrine differentiation with the tumor in the ileum. particularly suggestive of neuroendocrine differenciation and. that in the bladder more suggestive of more poorly differentiated. neuroendocrine tumor. However, immunohistochemical stains to. cytokeratins 7 and 20, synaptophysin and chromogranin applied to. blocks A7 (uterus) B2 (urinary bladder) and F2 (ileum) show the. tumor in all three sites to be strongly reactive for cytokeratin. 7 with only tocal strong dot cytoplasmic reactivity for. cytokeratin 20 in the ileum and focal reactivity to chromogranin. in the endometrium and the ileum. There is no reactivity to. synaptophysin in any of the three sites. The block from the. ilcum was also scained for CD56 and shows weak diffuse. reactivity. The positive and negative controls worked. appropriately. The above findings are most consistenc with a. primary poorly differentiated endometrioid endometrial. adenocarcinoma with aquamous differenciation and focal. neuroendocrine differentiation. I do not see evidence of serous. endometrial carcinoma, however, disregarding its classification. the present tumor has already expressed its poor biological. nature.

COMMENT: The diffuse malignant mesothelioma shows characteristic tubulopapillary growth pattern, associated with extensive. pleural and angiolymphatic infiltration. Immunostains show a typical pattern of staining for malignant mesothelioma. within neoplastic cells expressing nuclear calretiniri, cytokeratin 5/6, thrombomodulin, D2-40, and WT-1, and failing to. express TTF-1, CEA, B72.3, Leu-M1, PSA, thyroglobulin, and CDX-2. Focal expression of BerEP4 is présent. Histochemical stains show glycogen expression with PAS stains, but no intracytoplasmic neutral mucin production with. diastase pre-digestive PAS stains. Overall, this histomorphology and immunophenotype is characteristic of a diffuse. malignant mesothelloma. Samples of the level-7 and level-5 lymph nodes show occasional cells within the subcapsular sinus of the nodes,. documented by cytokeratin stains. For this reason, we would stage this pleural mesothelioma as a T4N1 malignant. mesothelioma. Addendum. This case has been reviewed at the. where the diagnosis. of malignant mesothelioma was confirmed. Addendum. Probe: LSI 9p21/CEP9 Dual Color Probe. Cytogenetic Location: 9p21; Centromere 9. Probe Description: LSI 9p21 dual color DNA probe hybridizes to the band. 9p21 and the centromere of chromosome 9, This probe may be useful for the detection of the p16 region associated with. 9p21. The SpectrumOrange LSI p16 probe spans approximately 190 kb and contains a number of genetic loci including.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received unfixed in five parts. Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""left tonsil,. short. stitch superior, long stitch posterior"". The specimen consists of a. 3.0 X 2.2. X 1.5 cm tonsillectomy. There is a long suture designating the. posterior and. a short suture designating superior. There is a tan-gray, soft and firm lesion present measuring 2.1 X 1.2. x. 1.0. cm. The lesion comes to within 0.2 cm of the posterior margin. The. lesion is. 0.3 cm from superior, 0.4 cm from anterior, 0.2 cm from the deep and. 0.2 cm. from anterior. Remainder of the specimen consists of tan-gray, soft focally. hemorrhagic. amount of mucosa and tan-brown, focally hemorrhagic muscle. Following. frozen. section consult digital images are taken. Banked for. Ink code: Blue- superior. Green- posterior. Black- deep. Orange - inferior. Red- anterior and Area banked. Section code: 1AFS - remainder of the tissue is frozen is submitted. 1B - shave of the superior margin. 1C - shave of the inferior margin. 1D-1G - remainder of specimen entirely submitted. Formalin exposure time: 30 hours. Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""left. posterior. pharyngeal wall"". It the specimen consists of a 1.2 X 0.5 X 0.3 cm. tan-gray,. soft to firm strip of mucosa and roughened tissue. The specimen is. entirely. submitted in cassette labeled 2A. Formalin exposure time: 28 hours. Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""left deep. constrictor"" The specimen consists of a tan-brown, soft to firm,. roughened. and cauterized un-oriented fragment of tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.6 X 0.3. cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 3A. Formalin exposure time: 28 hours. Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""soft. palate"" The. specimen consists of a tan-pink, soft to firm and cauterized portion of. tissue. measuring 0.6 x 0.3 X 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted. cassette. labeled 4A. Formalin exposure time: 28 hours. Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and ""right. tonsil"". The specimen consists of a 3.0 X 2.0 x 1.0 cm tan-pink, soft, focally. hemorrhagic, cauterized and un-oriented portion of tissue grossly. resembling a. tonsil. The area of cautery is inked and the specimen is serially. cross. sectioned. Upon cross section reveals multiple crypts with yellow. mucoid. material present. The specimen is entirely submitted on cut surface in. cassettes labeled 5A through 5C. Formalin exposure time: 28 hours.
