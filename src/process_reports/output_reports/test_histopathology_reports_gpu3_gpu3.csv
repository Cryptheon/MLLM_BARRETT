Foci of in situ papillary serous adenocarcinoma are noted in the tubal epithelium. One fallopian tube is not identified, while the other shows metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The uterus shows diffuse serosal metastasis by papillary serous carcinoma, with extensive lymphovascular space permeation by tumor in the myometrium, lower uterine segment, and cervix. The endometrium is inactive, with an incidental endometrial polyp. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in the paracervical soft tissue and the anterior cul-de-sac biopsy. The omentum is almost completely effaced by metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma."

COMMENT: A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported. to be associated with a relatively diminished response to Temodar (. Hence, the. low 5% result in this case suggests a likelihood of this tumor being responsive to Temodar. Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic significance of increased expression of laminin beta 1 and decreased. expression of laminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas. between laminin-8 and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival. Patient Case(s). Page I or -. PATIENT RESULIS. DR. Accordingly, elevated expression of beta 1 and focally suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict more. aggressive behavior. Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as detected by immunostaining was. significantly correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Hence the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when combined with EGFRvIII. mutation, permits a possibility of this tumor being responsive to EGFR-kinase inhibitors. Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable prograncie in national with high. grade gliomas (. Molecular subclasses of high-grade glioma. predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and resemble stages in neurogenesis. Cancer Cell. Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42/44 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) has been shown to be. associated with a relative resistance of glioblastoma multiforme to radiation therapy. Prognostic Associations of Activated Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase and Akt Pathways in. Glioblastoma. Correspondingly, a high percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody in this case predicts a. relative resistance to radiation therapy. The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical correlation is. advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic agents. IDC2a: Selected slides were reviewed in consultation with. HISTORY: Neurologic symptoms multiple.

COMMENT: Liver Tumor, Including Intrahepatic Bile Duct, Synoptic Comment. - Tumor type: Mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma. - Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. Tumor size (maximum diameter of largest lesion) : 12.1 cm. - Tumor necrosis: <30%. Multifocality (more than one tumor separated by nontumorous liver. parenchyma) : Present. - Estimated total tumor diameter of all HCC foci: >12 cm. - Vascular invasion: Present in both large and small vessels (B2, B3,. B8). - Hepatic capsule: Tumor abuts capsule. - Local extension of tumor: Confined to liver. - Hepatic surgical margins: Positive (slide B3) ; see comment. - Bile duct margin (for cholangiocarcinoma) : Negative. - Non-neoplastic liver: No significant pathologic abnormality. - Lymph node status: Negative. - Negative; total number of nodes examined: 3. - AJCC Stage: pT3bNO. Immunoperoxidase and special stains were performed to confirm the. diagnosis and show the following staining pattern in tumor cells: - Chromogranin: Negative. - Synaptophysin: Negative. Arginase: Patchy positive, negative in some areas showing glandular. lifferentiation. - CK19: Strong and diffusely positive. - Mucicarmine: Negative. - MIB1: Briskly positive, with nuclear staining up to 40-50% of cells. Overall, the histopathology and immunohistochemical profile support a. diagnosis of mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocarcinoma. Histologic. sections show divergent differentiation with some larger cells showing. eosinophilic cytoplasm or fatty differentiation. These cells are. arranged in a trabecular architecture. Both the morphology as well as. strong positive staining for arginase supports hepatoid differentiation. in these areas. In other areas, discrete glands within sclerotic stroma. are seen. Luminal necrosis is seen within glands. A subset of these. areas of glandular differerentiation lack arginase staining. This. finding, along with the presence of necrosis provide evidence for a. component of cholangiocarcinoma. Of note, a mucicarmine stain is. negative, indicating a lack of mucin; however, this does not preclude a. diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. MIB1 staining shows a proliferative. index of up to 40-50%, suggesting a highly proliferative malignancy. Negative staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin argues against. neuroendocrine differentiation. Sections at the periphery of the main mass show multiple smaller. nodules, some of which are only apparent microscopically One of these. small nodules is found at the margin (slide B3) It is possible that. this nodule may represent venous invasion. have reviewed portions of this case. and concur with the diagnosis.

Part A is designated ""left level 2B lymph node"" and consists of a 0.9 x 0.7 x 0,4 cm lymph node. The. specimen is biseoted and entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in cryoblock FSA1. Following. frozen section diagnosis, half of the specimen is sent for molecular diagnostic studies (one piece - 1.9 x 0.9. x 0.2 cm). The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in block Al in B-plus for permanent. sections (one piece - 1.9 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm). Part B is designated ""right skin lesion"" and consists of a 1.6 x 0.9 cm ellipse of skin with attached. subcutaneous tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm. The skin surface is white and unremarkable, no lesions. are identified. Sectioning demonstrates an ill-defined pale area underlying the skin surface, measuring 0.9 x. 0.5 x 1.0 cm.

Sectioning demonstrates a 2.7 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm tan-gray nodule. Adjacent to this larger nodule is. a. smaller nodule which measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.

The skin lesion shows diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The lymph nodes are involved by lymphoma with a non-cleaved morphology. The paraffin markers indicate a B-cell lymphoma. The lymphoma cells are positive for CD20 and BCL-2, and negative for CD45RO and CD79a. The lymph nodes have a tan-gray nodule with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma infiltrate. The skin lesion has an ill-defined pale area underlying the skin surface with a lymphoma infiltrate. The lymphoma cells have a non-cleaved morphology with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. No necrosis is identified. The lymphoma infiltrate is present in the lymph node and skin lesion. The lymph node and skin lesion margins are not evaluated for involvement by lymphoma. Benign salivary gland tissue is present with no diagnostic pathology."

I have personally reviewed the diagnostic material and this report represents my interpretation.","Paraganglioma with a variegated, tan-pink and red cross section, having cystic areas and focal areas of calcification and necrosis. The tumor has sharp, well-demarcated borders from the adrenal gland. Pheochromocytoma with a well-circumscribed nodule, having a tan-pink medulla and yellow cortices. The nodule is composed of cells with distinct cell borders and a nested growth pattern. No lymphovascular invasion is identified. Four benign lymph nodes are present. The tumor is completely excised with no involvement of the adrenal gland margins. No necrosis is identified in the paraganglioma. The pheochromocytoma has focal areas of necrosis and calcification.
