No tumor is present in lymph nodes, only unremarkable thymus with one positive capsular with lymph node showing neoplasm involving intramusstantial pericholestasis. Margin cannot be made for assessment of the left subtotal thyroid. A lymphoplasmacyticum is seen away from the tumor but not within adipose tissue margin. Focal thymic adenoma are seen in both soft tissue lymph nodes, along at previous dissection may be focally near the neck level four to pre and inferior paratrachea.
