Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present. Entire report and diagnosis completed by. COMMENT. The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the transition zone and occupies. practically the entire anterior half of the prostate. The tumor focus measures 3.5 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension,. and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. Focal extension of. tumor (less than 1.0 mm) to the left apical margin cannot be excluded. GROSS DESCRIPTION. (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and. attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (4.5 x 4.5 X 3.9 cm, 42 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the. right. and. left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left anterior surface of the. prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the anterior portion of the prostate. of. both cross sections. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

B: Gallbladder, cholecystectomy. - Cholesterolosis. - No evidence of cholelithiasis. - Two lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/2). Comment: None. Clinical History: The patient is with liver carcinoma. Gross Description: Two appropriately labeled containers are received. Container A is additionally labeled ""right hepatic trisegment"". The specimen was delivered to the gross. room by tissue procurement and subsequently placed in formalin. The specimen weighs 1280 gm, and. measures 19.5 x 17 x 12.5 cm. The surgical margin is inked green and demonstrates a rough irregular. surface. The liver capsule is red/brown, somewhat rubbery in architecture. A 6.7 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm somewhat. elliptical defect is present in the capsule of the liver from which a portion of the tumor has been removed. Serial sectioning reveals 12 x 11 x 10 cm well circumscribed white soft friable tumor. Throughout the. tumor there are scattered areas of black char-like pigment and areas of questionable necrosis. There are two foci of questionable extracapsular extension of the tumor. These areas are 1.0 cm in greatest. diameter and 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. Grossly the tumor appears to be less than 0.1 cm from the. surgical green inked margin and focally may extend to the margin. The remainder of the liver is tan/brown. with a somewhat micronodular pattern. Representative sections are submitted per block summary. A1-A2 - representative sections of tumor with adjacent surgical green inked margin. A3-A5 - representative sections of tumor. A6 - tumor at site of extracapsular extension. A7-A10 - representative sections of tumor. A11 - normal appearing liver. Container B is additionally labeled ""gallbladder"". Previously opened: Yes, there is one small foci in the distal portion of the gallbladder that is 0.3 cm in. greatest diameter. Measurements: 9.2 x 3.1 x 1.4 cm. External surface: Yellow/green/tan one surface of which is smooth and glistening and the opposite surface. is somewhat fibrotic which probably represents the hepatic attachment. There also are numerous fungating. yellow/tan nodules from the external surface at the distal portion of the gallbladder these nodules are 1.3 x. 1.0 x 0.8 cm. These nodules are also located at the proximal portion of the gallbladder and range in size. from 0.5 x 0.5 to 0.7 x 0.7 cm. Wall thickness: 0.2 cm. Mucosa: green velvety with cholesterolosis. Stones present: not identified. Other comments: none. Block B1: Cystic duct margin and representative section of lymph node located at the cystic duct as well as. nodules at the proximal portion of the gallbladder. B2: Representative sections of the body of the gallbladder and distal portion of gallbladder at site of. nodules. Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY (210.5g) : RENAL CELL CARCINOMA,/ clear cell type, 4.2 cm, involving lower pole, Fuhrman. nuclear grade II (of IV). Tumor is confined to the kidney. Soft tissue margin of resection is negative for tumor. Renal vein, renal artery, and ureteral margins are negative for tumor. No lymphovascular invasion present. AJCC Stage (6th edition) : Tlb NO MX. REGIONAL LYMPH NODES, BIOPSY: Four lymph nodes with no tumor present. EVALUATION OF NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY (NEPHRECTOMY SPECIMEN) : KIDNEY WITH MINOR, NON-SPECIFIC ABNORMALITIES, INCLUDING MILD FOCAL GLOBAL. GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (4% OF TOTAL GLOMERULI). ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MILD TO MODERATE. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. The sample consists of kidney cortex and medulla. There are up to one. hundred ninety six (196) glomeruli present in the sample submitted for light. microscopy. Eight (8) glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed). The. preserved glomeruli show normal cellularity and reveal no significant. pathological changes. Very mild mesangial expansion and occasional reabsorption. granules are recognized. On PAS and. silver methenamine stain, the. glomerular basement membranes appear of normal thickness. Tubules are well. preserved; occasional tubules are mildly distended and show few hyaline casts. The interstitium shows minimal fibrosis and mononuclear inflammation. Less than. 5% of the sample shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced. on the trichrome stains (AFOG) Arteries and arterioles reveal mils to. moderate sclerosis of the wall, with focal hyalinosis and mild signs of. vasoconstriction in the arteriolar walls. The non-neoplastic kidney was evaluated by. Renal Pathology. CLINICAL DATA: History: with incidental finding of (L) renal mass. Operation: Not specified. Operative Findings: None given. Clinical Diagnosis: Not provided. TISSUE SUBMITTED. A/1. (L) kidney - FS. B/2. Regional nodes. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient?s. name and unit number. Part A, received fresh in the frozen section lab, labeled ""#1. (L) kidney -. FS"", consists of a left `nephrectomy specimen (210.5 gm; 11.7 x 6.5 x 4.8 cm). to. include ureter (6.8 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter). renal veins (1.4 cm in. length x 0.5 cm in diameter each) renal artery (2.3 cm in length x 0.4 cm in. diameter), and scant loosely attached perinephric fat (7.2 x 5:2 ""Cm. predominately at the lower pole) - The specimen is inked black and bivalved,. revealing a golden yellow, focally hemorrhagic, predominately solid. encapsulated mass (4. 2 x 3.5 x 3.9 cm) within the lower pole, 4.5 cm from the. ureter, 1.6 cm from the nearest renal vein margin, and 2.6 cm from the renal. artery margin. The mass grossly abuts the renal capsule but does not appear to. invade through the capsule into the perinephric fat. Representative sections. of the mass are submitted to the tissue bank, cytogenetics; and electron. microscopy for special studies. Representative normal cortex is held for. future electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and tissue banking studies. The renal pelvis displays unremarkable tan/white glistening urothelium. The. cortical medullary junction is well-demarcated with no other gross lesions. identified. No lymph nodes are identified within the scant perihilar or. perinephric fat. The adrenal gland is not identified. Photographs are taken. Micro A1: Ureteral, renal vein, and renal artery margins, (en face), 4. frags total,. Micro A2: ""Tl"" (tumor quick-fix), 1 frag,. Micro. A3-A4: Deepest extension of mass in relationship to perinephric fat and. capsule, 2 frags,. Micro A5: Focally cystic component of mass to include areas of hemorrhage,. 1 frag,.
