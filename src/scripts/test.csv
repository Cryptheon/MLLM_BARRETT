High grade dysplasia.",,,,,,,,,,"[""### Processed Report for Vision-Language Model Training\n\n#### Tumor Type and Characteristics\n- **Adenocarcinoma** of the esophagus, moderately differentiated.\n- **Growth Pattern**: Not explicitly stated, but given the context, it's likely to be a mix of glandular and possibly solid patterns, typical of adenocarcinomas.\n- **Cellular Characteristics**: Not detailed, but adenocarcinoma cells are typically polygonal with varying degrees of pleomorphism and atypia.\n- **Nuclear Features**: Moderate pleomorphism is mentioned, indicating variations in nuclear size and shape, but specific details like nucleoli prominence are not provided.\n- **Mitotic Figures and Atypical Mitoses**: Not explicitly mentioned, but their presence would be consistent with the moderately differentiated nature of the tumor.\n\n#### Tumor Grading\n- **Histologic Grade**: Moderately differentiated (G2), implying moderate pleomorphism and a certain level of mitotic activity, though not quantified.\n\n#### Tumor Extension and Invasion\n- **Tumor Confinement**: The tumor invades into the submucosa.\n- **Invasion into Adjacent Structures**: No angiolymphatic invasion is seen. The tumor comes close to the adventitial surgical resection margin but does not invade it, based on the microscopic examination.\n\n#### Tumor Necrosis and Additional Features\n- **Necrosis**: Not mentioned, suggesting its absence or minimal presence that does not significantly impact the tumor's characteristics.\n- **Specific Tissue Responses**: Background gastroesophageal mucosa shows Barrett's mucosa, indicating intestinal metaplasia. A separate focus of high-grade dysplasia is noted 1.6 cm distally from the main tumor.\n\n#### Margin Status\n- **Tumor Involvement at Margins**: The proximal, distal, and circumferential (adventitial) margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. However, the tumor comes close to the adventitial margin, but exact distance is not considered relevant for visual model training. \n\n#### Excluded Information\n- All macroscopic descriptions, molecular data, immunohistochemistry results, and clinical information have been excluded as per the guidelines.""]"
