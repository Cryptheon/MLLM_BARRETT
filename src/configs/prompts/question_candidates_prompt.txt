Given a pathology report, extract only the histology-based questions that can be directly answered from microscopic images. Ensure questions focus on tumor type, cellular and architectural characteristics, nuclear features, mitotic activity, necrosis, invasion patterns, and margin involvement. Avoid questions about macroscopic descriptions, immunohistochemistry, molecular data, and TNM staging. Do not ask about tumor size or numerical distances. Format the output as a list of precise, structured questions suitable for training a vision-language model on histology images.

#### 1. General Approach to Generating Relevant Sub-Questions
- Only generate questions that can be answered directly from histology images.
  - Do not create questions about metadata (e.g., patient history, submission details, procedure descriptions).
  - Exclude questions that require macroscopic, immunohistochemical, or molecular data.
- Frame questions based on observable histological features that a deep learning model could learn to classify.
- Avoid numerical precision questions (e.g., tumor size, exact distances from margins). Instead, ask whether tumor cells are present or absent in a specific region.

#### 2. Tumor Identification and Classification Questions
- What histologic tumor type(s) are present?
- Are there distinct tumor subtypes within the specimen?
- What are the predominant architectural patterns of the tumor (papillary, solid, glandular, etc.)?
- What are the characteristic cytoplasmic features (eosinophilic, clear, vacuolated, etc.)?
- What nuclear features are observed (pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, prominent nucleoli, etc.)?
- Are mitotic figures present, and if so, how frequent are they?
- Is there evidence of atypical mitoses?

#### 3. Tumor Grading Questions
- What is the histologic grade of the tumor (if applicable)?
- What nuclear and architectural characteristics support this grading?
- Are nucleoli visible at high magnification, and how prominent are they?
- Are there significant variations in nuclear size and shape?

#### 4. Tumor Extension and Invasion Questions
- Is the tumor confined to the organ, or does it invade surrounding tissue?
- Is there evidence of tumor infiltration into adjacent adipose or muscle tissue?
- Does the tumor extend through the organ’s capsule?
- Are tumor cells present within blood or lymphatic vessels (lymphovascular invasion)?
- Is there evidence of perineural invasion (tumor cells surrounding nerves)?

#### 5. Tumor Necrosis and Additional Features Questions
- Is necrosis present within the tumor?
- If necrosis is present, is it focal or widespread?
- Is there evidence of fibrosis or a desmoplastic reaction around the tumor?
- Are inflammatory infiltrates present in or around the tumor?
- Are sarcomatoid features observed within the tumor?

#### 6. Margin Involvement Questions
- Are tumor cells present at the inked surgical margin?
- Is there any extension of tumor cells into the resection margin?
- Is the margin clear of invasive carcinoma?

#### 7. Exclusion of Non-Visual Questions
- Do NOT generate questions about:
  - Tumor size, weight, or volume.
  - Exact distances from tumor to margins.
  - Tumor focality (unifocal vs. multifocal) unless this distinction is made within a single slide.
  - TNM staging (since nodal and metastatic involvement is not determined solely from histology).
  - Immunohistochemistry markers or molecular findings.
  - Clinical diagnosis, radiological findings, or preoperative information.
