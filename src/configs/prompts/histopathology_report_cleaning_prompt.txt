Given a pathology report, extract only the histology-based findings that can be directly observed in microscopic images. Remove any metadata that is not visually inferable. Focus on type, architecture, cellular characteristics, nuclear features, presence of necrosis, invasion into adjacent structures, and margin involvement. Exclude macroscopic descriptions, exact distances, molecular data, and immunohistochemistry results. Ensure the output is concise and formatted to facilitate training of a vision-language model on histology images. Do not include size in centimers (cm) or diameters.

Try to keep the same language as the pathologist used in the report. Do not change/modify or transform the report too much! Give the report in running text.

Make sure to only give the modified report, nothing else!

# Follow the following steps and guidelines:

1. General Approach to Preprocessing Pathology Reports

Remove all metadata that is not visually inferable from histology images.

Exclude patient details, submission dates, procedure details, laterality, and accession numbers.

Focus only on histology-based findings that can be derived from whole-slide images (WSIs) or biopsy scans.

Avoid macroscopic descriptions (e.g., gross specimen color, size, weight, and shape) unless those features can be directly observed under a microscope.

Preserve only morphologically relevant details that a model could learn to recognize in histology images.

Retain non-neoplastic findings (e.g., inflammation, glomerulosclerosis) as these may be visually inferable and sometimes are the only findings in tumor-free reports.

Retain negative findings (e.g., "not identified") for structures like lymph nodes or adrenal glands, as these help inform the model about visual absence.

Keep wording as close as possible to the original pathology report to preserve consistency with diagnostic language.

2. Tumor Identification and Classification

Identify the histologic tumor type(s) (e.g., papillary renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma).

Include architectural and cellular characteristics visible in histology, such as:

Growth patterns (papillary, solid, glandular, trabecular, etc.).

Cell shape (polygonal, spindle, round, etc.).

Cytoplasmic characteristics (clear, eosinophilic, granular, vacuolated, etc.).

Nuclear features (pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, nucleoli prominence).

Presence of mitotic figures and atypical mitoses.

3. Tumor Grading (If Applicable)

Provide the histologic grade and keep original notation (e.g., "Fuhrman nuclear grade II/IV") when available.

Justify grades with visual criteria such as nuclear features, mitotic activity, and architectural patterns.

4. Tumor Extension and Invasion

Describe whether the tumor is confined to the organ or extends beyond it.

Example: "Tumor remains within renal parenchyma" or "Tumor infiltrates surrounding adipose tissue."

Identify any invasion into adjacent structures visible in histology:

Capsular invasion

Lymphovascular invasion (tumor cells inside blood or lymphatic vessels)

Perineural invasion (tumor cells surrounding nerves)

Retain negative statements such as "Local invasion not identified" or "Renal vein invasion not identified."

5. Tumor Necrosis and Additional Features

Indicate the presence or absence of necrosis.

Example: "Foci of coagulative necrosis present" or "No necrosis identified."

Identify specific tissue responses, such as:

Desmoplastic reaction (fibrosis around tumor).

Inflammatory infiltrates (lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc.).

Sarcomatoid transformation (if present, describe morphology).

Retain non-neoplastic findings (e.g., chronic inflammation, glomerulosclerosis) if histologically evident.

6. Margin Status (Without Absolute Distances)

State whether tumor cells are present at the resection margin.

Example: "Tumor cells reach the inked margin" or "No tumor involvement at the inked margin."

Avoid specifying exact distances (e.g., "Tumor is 1 mm from margin") unless the dataset includes precise annotations for spatial measurements.

7. Exclusion of Non-Visual Data

Do NOT include:

TNM staging (since nodal and metastatic involvement is not determined solely from histology).

Immunohistochemistry results (as IHC markers are not visible in H&E-stained images).

Genetic or molecular findings (e.g., mutations, copy number variations).

Clinical diagnosis, patient history, or any preoperative information.

Radiological, endoscopic, or macroscopic descriptions unless they directly correlate with histology.

8. Format of the Processed Report for a Vision-Language System

The processed output should contain:

Histologic tumor type(s) with visual characteristics.

Grading (if applicable) with histology-based justification.

Tumor confinement or invasion status.

Necrosis, margin involvement, non-neoplastic features, and additional histology-based observations.

Negative findings and absence of structures where appropriate.

Information should be written clearly and concisely while maintaining detail relevant to image-based learning.

Wording should closely match the language used in original reports to ensure alignment with clinical terminology.
